            <h2>So why a page about guinea pigs?</h2>
            <p>I can hear you asking that question and the truth
            is that this is a page about guinea pigs because
            I didn't know what else to make it about. So without
            further ado, allow me to introduce our two guinea
            pigs: Cocoa and Marshmallow!</p>

              <p>This is Cocoa. He is Marshmallow's father
                and loves to eat the fluffy ends of the hay. He's
                smaller than his son, but is also much more
                outgoing and doesn't mind being picked up.</p>

                <p>This is Marshmallow. Marshmallow is quite a bit
                bigger than his father, but he is also much more
                skittish. He has gotten better about being picked up
                and petted, but still prefers to find a dark spot to
                hide in if given the choice.</p>

              <H3>The Story of Cocoa and Marshmallow</H3>
              <p>We got Cocoa and Marshmallow for Christmas 2018 as a
                surprise for our son. Cassandra has grown up with guinea
                pigs and so knew how to take care of them, but we were
                both surprised by how much cage standards had changed (
                for the better) over the years. Cocoa and Marshmallow
                live in a spacious enclosure with lots of hay, a water
                botter, and several places to hide. They also get plenty
                of attention and are well loved.</p>
