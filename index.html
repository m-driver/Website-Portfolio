            <h1>What is this webpage portfolio?</h1>
          </div>
          <p>I am presently a student at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville
            anticipating to receive a Master of Science in Information Sciences
            in August of 2008. I began studying information sciences because of
            my long-time love of information organizations and a desire to build
            a career helping others.</p>
          <p>While studying for my M.S.I.S. I would come across jobs that would
            request documented evidence of knowledge of programming and web skills
            like HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and others. I am building this website
            to demonstrate that knoweldge and ability.</p>
          <p>Below is a series of "portfolio webpages" that were built to
            demonstrate knowledge of webpage construction, HTML, JavaScript,
            and CSS. Of course, one of the most wonderful thing about coding is
            that it is always changing and there are always new things to learn.
            I appreciate you taking the time to review my page and hope that my
            work demonstrates to you my ability to use these technologies.</p>

It demonstrates the use of Flexbox coding for this list of webpages, the importation of fonts (this page uses @Font-Face to import Playfair Google font), creation of a sticky top menu, CSS coding for design elements, and a reactive design.</p>
